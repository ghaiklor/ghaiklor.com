So... Why I created this blog?

First of all, I hope that I'll share with you some little hacks about Node JS or JavaScript development. Of course, it will be not only JavaScript. A little bit of Amazon, Linux Administration, highload, etc... If I found some useful things, I'll share it with you anyway.

My name is Eugene Obrezkov and I working with IT and development from 3 years old. My father was ASM developer and he teach me a lot in my childhood about programming.

From 5 years old I already know some popular languages in that time like Pascal, Visual Basic, Assembler.

And you know, I like it. I really like what I'm doing. I am 22 years old. And my whole life it's development. I had worked with many things within this time: Pascal, Delphi, ASM, C++, C#, Qt, Unity, Reverse Engineering and a lot more.

Right now, I'm NodeJS Technical Leader with experience 4+ years.
