So... You might want to ask me. Why I created this blog?

First of all, I hope that I'll share with you some workarounds in NodeJS or JavaScript. Of course, it will be not only JavaScript. A little bit of Amazon, Linux Administration, highload, interesting modules, etc... If I found some useful things, I'll share it with you anyway.

My name is Eugene Obrezkov and I'm developing from 3 years old. My father is ASM\C++ developer from 1990 and he taught me a lot in my childhood about programming.

<!--MORE-->

From 5 years old I knew some popular languages in that time like Pascal, Visual Basic, Assembler. I don't talking about experience in Assembler or Pascal. I want to say, that I was able to create simple own programs in 5 years old. I understood how to create algorithm and implement it in some language.

And you know, I liked it. I really like creating some algorithms. Then trying to figure out a way to implement it. I like it.

My whole life was and is - it's development. I had worked with many things within my life: Pascal, Delphi, ASM, C++, C#, Qt, Unity, Reverse Engineering, Software Testing and a lot a lot more.

So here I'll be writing workarounds and sharing with you my knowledge.
